TODO list of things related to Linux apart from configs:

1. Report bug/solve tile-gaps kde wayland (i think) bug
    a. Learn kwin scripting (develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin)

2. Setup keepassXC cloud sync (automate after file change)
    a. Also look into how to avoid merge conflicts
    Ex: let's suppose keepass client on Android updates the db, but cannot sync with remote (home) server, and while at
        it, keepass linux client also updates the file. How would one resolve such a conflict? Look into this.
